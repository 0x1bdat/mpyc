If someone draws their own name, they have to start all over again. \n",

    "Mathematically, the Secret Santa problem is about generating so-called [derangements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement), which are permutations without fixed points. A permutation is a one-to-one mapping on a set of numbers, and a fixed-point is a number that is mapped to itself. \n",
